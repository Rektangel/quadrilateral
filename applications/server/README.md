# Prerequisites

- Node >=14.6.0
- MongoDb >=4.2.8

## Install mongoDB

For macOS the easiest way is to install with Homebrew. You can read the detailed steps [here](https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew).

If you are lazy the shortened version is to first add the tap with `brew tap mongodb/brew`. Then install mongoDb with `brew install mongodb-community`. Finally, start the background service with `brew services start mongodb-community`.
